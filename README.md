<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great tutoring websites for programming, however, we didn't find one that was free so we created this one for those who can't afford it. We want to create a completely free, forever, so anyone can get coding help.

Here's why:
* Everyone deserves an equal chance to learn to code. No one should be behind because they can't afford it.
* During the Covid-19 era, online tutoring is even more important as all learning starts to become virtual

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of resources we used are listed in the acknowledgements.
